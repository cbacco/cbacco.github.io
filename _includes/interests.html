			    My personal interests include:
        </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>
				 <b>Capture The Flag</b>. I'm very interested in vulnerabilities and exploits and this just turns it into a competition. Keeps my knowledge up on the latest and greatest for security awareness. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>Road and Mountain Biking</b>. I really enjoy turning the pedals over on the dirt, tarmac and gravel roads. I have entered quite a few races ranging from 30-60 miles of technical single track and have really loved it. 
			  </li>
			  <li>
				  <b>My daughter Ava</b>. My daughter is a little over a year old and has been the single greatest thing to ever happen to me. I really enjoy watching her learn new things and explore her world every day.
