            I have over 5 years of experience as a security engineer, and have worked
            in both IT and Security roles. While I'm proficient in python, my expertise is in building and maintaining security programs from the ground up. 
        </p>

           I love building things to solve problems. 
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems.
           Whether that is securing a cloud platform, inserting security practices into your CI/CD pipeline, 
           or creating a proper vulnerability management program - it's finding solutions that I am most keen on.
